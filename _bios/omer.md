bio: >
   Hey everyone! My name is Omer Cohen, I am a 4th year Computer Science major, I transferred into the major from Mathematical Sciences my  Sophomore year. I’m interested in Machine learning, business analytic software and IOS mobile app development! Unfortunately, UCSB doesn’t offer any courses in Swift however I took it upon myself to learn it. This summer I am interning at a defense contractor in Goleta called L3 Technologies in Goleta. There I worked applications that involved socket programming in C, as well as a User Interface application in visual basic (.net). Some of the CS courses I’ve taken include: Artificial Intelligence (cs165a), Parallel Programming (cs140), Computer Networking (176a), Data Structures and Algorithms II (130B). When I’m not programming, I like to play basketball, I am a huge Lakers fan, and I like food. I took cs56 in the Fall of 2017, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need advice!
