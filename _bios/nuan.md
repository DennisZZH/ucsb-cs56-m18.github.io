  Hi! This is Nuan and I am excited to become your mentor for CS56 this summer:). I am a soon-to-be fourth-year CS undergraduate at UCSB and I took CS56 about two years ago. 
  Currently I am doing ml/dl-related research under Prof. Yan's instruction. I am also very excited about application development and especially _web app_ ! 
  I've never tried to build web app with java before, and I am really looking forward to what we can achieve over the summer. 
  I once worked as a front-end software engineer intern--feel free to ask me more about it if interested! 
  Happy coding!
