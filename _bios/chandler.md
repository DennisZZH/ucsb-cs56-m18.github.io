bio: >
	My name is Chandler. I’m a fifth year computer science major. I was originally a chemistry major and was lucky enough to switch into CS at the beginning of my third year and have loved it ever since! I did an internship last summer at a small company in downtown Santa Barbara slinging Java code, and this summer I’m doing programming language research under Ben Hardekopf in the PLλab. I’m also one of the head coordinators for SB Hacks, UCSB’s yearly hackathon, and enjoy learning new programming languages (very slowly) on my own time. I’m super open to talking about anything CS related and if you’re into retro video games or Magic the Gathering, I’m your guy. Cheers!
